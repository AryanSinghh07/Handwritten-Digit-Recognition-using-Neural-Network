# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Network üß†üñäÔ∏è

This project implements a **Handwritten Digit Recognition System** using a **Neural Network (NN)** trained on the MNIST dataset. Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in machine learning and computer vision. It involves recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) from images or scanned documents. This task is widely used as a benchmark for evaluating machine learning models especially neural networks due to its simplicity and real-world applications such as postal code recognition and bank check processing. In this article we will implement Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Network.
