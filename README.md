# 🧠✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks !

This project implements a **Handwritten Digit Recognition System** using a **Neural Network (NN)** trained on the MNIST dataset. Recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) is a foundational problem in machine learning and computer vision. It has practical applications such as **postal code digit recognition**, **bank check processing**, and **digitized document classification**.

This project showcases how a neural network can learn to identify handwritten digits with high accuracy using a simple dataset.
